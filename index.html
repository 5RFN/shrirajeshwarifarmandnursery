            At our sprawling farm, covering approximately 220 acres in Moti Mau, Kutch, we have nurtured a flourishing orchard boasting around 11,000 majestic Kesar Mango trees. Specializing in the cultivation of Organic Kesar Mangoes, alongside Watermelons, Muskmelons, Dragonfruits, Papayas, and Bananas, we ensure that every fruit bears the hallmark of unparalleled taste and purity, free from any harmful chemicals.

            But our commitment doesn't stop there. We've also established a premier Nursery, dedicated to the propagation of Mango, Chiku, and a variety of other fruit plants, nurturing the future of sustainable agriculture.
